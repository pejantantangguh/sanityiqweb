- Artwork submission
- Online proofing

### Estimating

We have addressed the age-old problem of estimating complex print jobs quickly and accurately. In fact, we have taken this to the point where your customers and sales staff can complete their own quotes online.

- We estimate a job across every press and sheet size combination in seconds
- Choose between input‑based pricing (Labour, machine and materials), catalogue pricing, or specific contract pricing per customer
- The ability to use market driven pricing for your sell price while still maintaining actual costs
- A toolbox full of automation options to control your impositions, control margins and automate booklet section creation with fold catalogue equivalency
- Customers and sales staff can quote all types of work online with the confidence that they cannot order something that your factory cannot produce.

### Production

The production management tools within printIQ focus on communicating information in real time to everyone within the factory. With tailor made views of a job for each department, we’ve delivered a tool that eliminates the in-trays, the talk and the re-work.

- printIQ in 3D separates the job from the estimate so you can freely update the production path without affecting your quote information
- Online production boards give you the full view of the floor regardless of where you are
- Tablet optimisation to keep you moving
- Time capture functionality directly from the job bag using a terminal, scanner, or smartphone app
