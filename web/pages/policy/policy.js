          printIQ strives to keep your personal information accurate. We have implemented

          provide you with access to your information, including making reasonable effort to provide
          you with online access and the opportunity to change your information. To protect your
          privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as
          a password and user ID, before granting access to your data. printIQ websites may limit
          access to specific individuals through the use of passwords and other personal

          printIQ is committed to protecting the information you provide us. To prevent unauthorised

          We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive
          data such as credit card information. SSL encryption is designed to make the information
          unreadable by anyone but us. This security measure is working when you see either the
          symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your
          browser window.

          Credit card numbers are used only for processing payment and are not used for other
          purposes. As part of real-time payment processing, printIQ subscribes to a fraud
          management service. This service gives you and printIQ an extra level of security to guard
          against credit card fraud to protect your financial data.

          Security
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom={true}>
          printIQ uses its own in-built forms-based authentication model that is based on the
          standard .NET authentication model. It allows you to maintain your own user accounts. It
          is completely independent to the Windows / domain account that you may run internally and
          does not require a CAL (Client Access License). If required, printIQ supports LDAP
          integration and can also utilise a single sign on approach with authentication being
          provided by another line of business application.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom={true}>
          When you host printIQ, there are 4 components; the web server upon which the application
          sits, the MS SQL Database, file storage to house your artwork and an artwork upload
          application that manages the transfer of files.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h5">Artwork transfer</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom={true}>
          Within printIQ, users will submit artwork and other supporting documents associated with
          their order. The transfer process takes the file directly from the browser to your FTP
          server over an SSL connection. The files do not pass through the printIQ application and
          are not stored in the database.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h5">Payment Gateway</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom={true}>
          printIQ uses Windcave (www.windcave.com) as its inbuilt credit card payment gateway. The
          solution is a hosted gateway delivered through an iframe from within printIQ. The user
          stays within printIQ for the duration of the transaction. The approach means that printIQ
          is PCI compliant and neither handles or stores credit card information.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h5">Ensuring that printIQ is a secure application</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom={true}>
          While the application is only as secure as the hardware that it sits upon, we take
          security seriously and have taken every step to ensure your application and data is
          secure.
