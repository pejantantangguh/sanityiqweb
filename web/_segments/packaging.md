SeoDesc: We take a manufacturing approach to give you the control and flexibility to cater for 3 dimensional finished sizes, sourcing offshore product, sea and road freight, internal transfer margins, storage and financing costs.

### Our Promise

In packaging, not everything is focused on the press, in some cases, there is no printing at all. However, the process is still a mix of machinery, materials and labour, it’s just that it may not be done on a printing press. Whether you’re producing from a roll, slitting or sheeting the roll first, running roll to roll, or manufacturing directly from sheets, printIQ understands the manufacturing process end to end.

### The how

The printIQ packaging functionality has been included as part of the printIQ core, to cater for all the specific needs of a packaging printer. By including the ability for finished sizes to be expressed in 3 dimensions, printIQ becomes far more than your average MIS. printIQ also supports a range of options such as calculators to deal with; duty and freight, transfer margins and financing costs. This means that all pricing is managed in a single system.

### The benefits
