CHILI Publish is recognised as the market leader in the world of variable data and document editing, everyone knows it, most people want it but the barriers to entry, up until now, have been too great. By partnering with CHILI Publish, printIQ is able to offer you a SaaS (Software as a subscription) option to complete your web2print offering. The IQconnect – CHILI Publish module delivers this functionality directly from within the printIQ MIS to provide an integrated and seamless workflow.

### The How

By combining the smarts of the printIQ pricing engine, our online web ordering workflow and the CHILI Publish document editing, we have produced a comprehensive online ordering process that can easily keep pace with the spiralling demands of today’s print customer. With the head-start of already being a web based MIS, we have extended the offering by tightly integrating CHILI Publish APIs to deliver template information, Meta data, annotations and artwork files within printIQ.

### The Benefits

1. Deliver a simple and seamless ordering process for template and VDP jobs
2. Avoid complex integration or manual re-entry as printIQ is both the ordering system and the MIS so your job is sitting in production once the order is completed
3. The SaaS licence model allows you access to the best software with a minimal upfront investment
4. The InDesign plug-in gives you the option to produce your own templates or have us take care of it for you
5. Extend the functionality of the IQapprove module by using CHILI Publish to annotate your proofs
