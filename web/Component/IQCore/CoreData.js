			"Quote Intelligence differs from traditional estimating software in that it understands the entire production process so it will map out all possible alternatives for the job to pass through the factory. We do this by integrating all your business rules within the pricing logic engine, with all the pricing rules based on your component inputs; such as labour, machines and materials. The simplified quoting process then adds a layer of control so that those with little or no experience can produce a detailed quote whilst ensuring that they can only quote what you can produce. The quote is then linked to the file upload, job bag and all production, inventory, and shipping details Everyone can quote.",
