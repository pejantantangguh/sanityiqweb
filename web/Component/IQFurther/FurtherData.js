The module polls the courier and pulls in the optimum price in real time, with the automated management tool kicking off as each item is being quoted. Upon completion of the job the automated process kicks-in a second time and books the shipping and draws down the chosen courier labels.",

			"In Australia we offer a courier quoting and booking process that provides the same process as above, however it offers access to an array of providers via a central hub. The module polls an aggregator and pulls in the optimum price in real time. Upon completion of the job the automated process books the shipping and draws down the chosen courier labels. The other option, in Australia, is to integrate with the Open Freight System in which you have your agreed rates loaded into the system rather than polling an aggregator. We still pull in the optimum price in real time. Upon completion of the job the automated process books the shipping and draws down the chosen courier labels.",
