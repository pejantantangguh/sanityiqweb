SeoDesc: Enfocus and printIQ team up to deliver true workflow automation
---

The IQconnect – Enfocus Switch module takes automation to a new level by integrating the printIQ MIS directly with your pre-press workflows. We now offer the ability to take an order online, accept payment, pre-flight files, proof, impose and send directly to the press without operator intervention. The result is a highly automated, and cost effective, workflow. For something that five years ago was a mere pipe dream, we’re now able to deliver this as an out of the box solution. This as a quantum shift in workflow automation and we’re therefore very proud to be partnering with Enfocus to deliver this functionality within printIQ.

The addition of Enfocus Pitstop and Switch technology within the printIQ workflow means we can now offer a fully integrated workflow solution that combines best in class OEM technologies with our own powerful set of integrated tools. Not only does this provide us with a competitive edge as a web based MIS provider to the digital offset, signage and wide format markets. It also brings added value to our customers by automating the checking, reporting and correcting of web-to-print orders immediately upon delivery to the printer. We then use Switch to connect your prepress workflow in intelligent and intuitive ways, thereby creating the smartest, automated production workflow in existence. The other massive benefit for our clients is the opportunity to replace disparate legacy software and outdated workflows.

PitStop Pro offers all the necessary interactive error checking and correction possibilities. Why manually check your files, when Enfocus offers a first level of automation through PitStop Server. PitStop Server is a hot folder-based application that allows automatic checking and correction of incoming PDF files. Switch fully automates the quality of your files and how they’re created, shared and received. Switch also integrates and connects to third-party applications in your workflow, linking everything together into a customized production flow.
